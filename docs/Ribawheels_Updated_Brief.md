# Ribawheels - Updated Hackathon Project Brief

## 1. Project Overview

Ribawheels is a decentralized marketplace for car sales on Starknet. The platform ensures secure transactions through validator-based verification, escrow in STRK and USDC, and NFT-based car ownership certificates.

## 2. Key Features

### Car Listings
Sellers can list cars with detailed descriptions including:
- Make and model
- Year and mileage
- VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)
- Chassis number
- Other unique identifiers
- Pricing in both STRK and USDC

### Validator System
- Validators must apply and undergo vetting by the admin
- Applications are approved or rejected before validators become active
- Only approved validators can participate in transactions

### Validator Rating System
- Buyers can rate validators after transactions (1â€“5 stars)
- Ratings are stored on-chain and averaged
- Historical rating data is maintained for transparency

### Buyer Choice of Validator
- Buyers can select from approved validators
- Validator profiles show ratings and fees
- Transparent validator selection process

### Dynamic Validator Fees
Validator fees are based on their rating tier:
- **Rating â‰¥ 4.5** â†’ 3% fee
- **Rating â‰¥ 3.0 and < 4.5** â†’ 2% fee  
- **Rating < 3.0** â†’ 1% fee

### Escrow System
- Supports both STRK and USDC for secure payments
- Funds held in smart contract until transaction completion
- Automatic fee distribution upon completion

### Car Ownership NFT
- Each listed car automatically mints an ERC-721 NFT
- NFT represents ownership certificate
- Transfers to buyer after successful purchase
- Immutable record of ownership history

### Admin Role
- Admin (contract owner) can approve/reject validators
- Remove fraudulent car listings
- Transfer admin rights to new address
- Platform governance and maintenance

### Wallet Swap Integration (Future Feature)
- Users can swap STRK â†” USDC within the marketplace wallet
- Planned for post-hackathon implementation
- Will integrate with DEX protocols on Starknet

## 3. Transaction Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Car Listing**
   - Seller provides car details and pricing
   - Car NFT is automatically minted to seller's address
   - Listing becomes active on the marketplace

2. **Validator Selection**
   - Buyer browses available validators
   - Reviews validator ratings and fees
   - Selects preferred validator and payment token (STRK or USDC)

3. **Escrow Creation**
   - Buyer pays car price + validator fee into escrow contract
   - Funds are locked until transaction completion
   - Escrow record created with all transaction details

4. **Vehicle Inspection**
   - Validator inspects the physical vehicle
   - Verifies car details against listing
   - Submits decision (proceed/reject) to smart contract

5. **Purchase Finalization**
   - **If proceed = true:**
     - Seller receives car price
     - Validator receives their fee
     - Car NFT transfers to buyer
     - Listing becomes inactive
   - **If proceed = false:**
     - Buyer receives refund minus small validator dispute fee
     - Validator receives dispute fee for their time
     - Car remains listed for sale

6. **Validator Rating**
   - Buyer rates validator performance (1â€“5 stars)
   - Rating recorded on-chain
   - Validator's average rating updated

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

### Admin/Owner
- **Validator Management**: Approve or reject validator applications
- **Content Moderation**: Remove fraudulent or inappropriate car listings
- **System Parameters**: Manage platform settings and fee structures
- **Ownership Transfer**: Can transfer admin rights to new address

### Seller
- **Car Listing**: Create detailed car listings with accurate information
- **Price Setting**: Set prices in both STRK and USDC
- **Payment Receipt**: Receive payments after successful transactions
- **Listing Management**: Can delist cars if needed

### Buyer
- **Validator Selection**: Choose from approved validators based on ratings/fees
- **Payment**: Pay via STRK or USDC through escrow system
- **Purchase Decision**: Final say on whether to complete purchase
- **Rating**: Rate validator performance after transactions

### Validator
- **Vehicle Inspection**: Physically inspect cars and verify details
- **Decision Making**: Provide honest assessment of vehicle condition
- **Fee Earning**: Receive fees based on rating tier
- **Reputation Building**: Build rating through quality service

## 5. Technical Implementation

### Smart Contracts Architecture

#### Built in Cairo 1.x for Starknet
- Modern Cairo syntax and features
- Optimized for Starknet's proving system
- Gas-efficient implementation

#### Marketplace Contract (`src/marketplace.cairo`)
Core contract handling:
- Car listing management
- Escrow operations
- Validator system
- Rating mechanism
- Admin functions
- Settlement logic

#### CarNFT Contract (`src/car_nft.cairo`)
ERC-721 compliant contract for:
- Car ownership certificates
- Metadata storage
- Transfer mechanisms
- Listing status tracking

#### Payment Token Support
- **STRK**: Native Starknet token
- **USDC**: Stable coin for price stability
- ERC-20 interface compatibility

### Key Technical Features

#### Validator Rating Algorithm
```cairo
fn _calculate_validator_fee(validator: ContractAddress, price: u256) -> u256 {
    let rating = get_validator_rating(validator);
    let fee_percentage = if rating >= 450 { // 4.5 stars * 100
        3
    } else if rating >= 300 { // 3.0 stars * 100
        2
    } else {
        1
    };
    (price * fee_percentage) / 100
}
```

#### Escrow State Management
- `Active`: Funds deposited, awaiting validator decision
- `ValidatorDecisionPending`: Validator has decided, awaiting buyer
- `Completed`: Transaction successful, funds distributed
- `Refunded`: Transaction cancelled, funds returned
- `Disputed`: Special case for dispute resolution

#### Gas Optimization
- Efficient storage patterns
- Minimal on-chain computation
- Batch operations where possible
